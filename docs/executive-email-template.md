Dear [Brian/Griselda],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the 3D Animation Artist position at Coronot.

As someone with a Master of Fine Arts in Architectural Lighting Design from Parsons School of Design, where I had the opportunity to specify Coronet fixtures in my design work, I have long admired Coronot's commitment to quality and precision. Your job posting for a 3D Animation Artist immediately caught my attention—it perfectly aligns with my unique combination of expertise in 3D animation, lighting design, and advertising.

Over the past four years, I have created 2D/3D animations for social ads, music videos, and campaigns for clients including Asics, LOEWE, Beggars Group, and numerous others. I'm particularly passionate about accurately representing lighting distribution in light fixture renders, understanding that beautiful marketing materials significantly influence specification decisions. My work has been recognized with a 2023 OBIE Craft Award from Billboard for creative excellence in advertising design.

I've been inspired by companies like Baso and DMF, whose product renders give real personality and stories to their fixtures. I'm excited by the prospect of bringing that same level of artistry to Coronot's product presentations.

I would welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how my background in animation, lighting design, and sound design can contribute to Coronot's marketing efforts. My portfolio and resume are available at [your portfolio URL].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Nicholas Byrne

Dear Mr. Osur,

I hope this message reaches you well. I am writing to directly express my interest in the 3D Animation Artist position at Coronot.

Having specified Coronet fixtures during my MFA studies in Architectural Lighting Design at Parsons School of Design, I have firsthand experience with your products and a deep appreciation for their quality. The opportunity to create animations that showcase Coronot products within realistic architectural environments represents a perfect convergence of my technical abilities, creative vision, and industry passion.

My background uniquely positions me for this role: my master's degree in Architectural Lighting Design, combined with four years of professional experience creating 3D animations for major brands (Asics, LOEWE, Budweiser), professional lighting design work, and a 2023 OBIE Craft Award for creative excellence. I'm passionate about how beautifully crafted marketing materials influence specification decisions—a perspective I gained through my professional network of lighting designers.

I've worked independently as a contractor across the music, fashion, and lighting industries for the past decade, consistently delivering high-quality work under tight deadlines. I am highly organized, reliable, and available to start immediately.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my animation expertise and lighting design background can enhance Coronot's product presentations. My portfolio and resume are available at [your portfolio URL].

Thank you for considering my application.

**To:** mario@coronetled.com

**Body:**

Dear Mario,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to express my interest in the 3D Animation Artist position at Coronot.

As an architectural lighting design graduate from Parsons who specified Coronet fixtures in my academic work, I've followed Coronot's growth with interest. Your opening for a 3D Animation Artist immediately stood out to me—it directly matches my niche skill set as an animator, advertising specialist, and sound designer with a lighting design MFA.

Throughout my career, I have specialized in creating compelling visual narratives that blend technical precision with cinematic storytelling. I've produced 3D animations for social ads and campaigns for clients including Workshop APD, Bandit Running, Asics, LOEWE, and many others. I'm particularly passionate about accurately representing lighting distribution in product renders, understanding the critical role that marketing materials play in the specification process.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the ability to combine my technical animation skills with my lighting design expertise and passion for music. I believe that lighting, visual composition, and sound can create elevated sensory experiences when combined thoughtfully.

Having worked as an independent contractor for over ten years across multiple industries, I am highly organized, reliable, and accustomed to working autonomously while meeting deadlines. I am available to start immediately.

I would welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute to Coronot's team. My portfolio and resume are available at [your portfolio URL].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
