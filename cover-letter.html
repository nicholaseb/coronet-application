                <p class="greeting">Dear Coronet Team,</p>

                <p>
                    I'm excited to apply for this position. After getting my MFA in Architectural Lighting Design from Parsons and working in animation for the past five years, this role feels like the perfect match for my experience. I actually specified Coronet fixtures during my time at Parsons training as a lighting designer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've been animating product features and creating campaigns at my creative agency Router since 2020, working with brands like Workshop APD, Asics, LOEWE, and many major record labels. I love that lighting animation translates technical product details into stories and beautiful aesthetics that actually connect with people. Animating Coronet products would be a dream job given my animation skills, lighting background, and creative interests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technically, I work in Blender, Rhino for 3D animation, and After Effects for 2D and video editing, and I use Ableton for music + audio editing. I often customize music to perfectly fit the needs of an ad or animation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I work at the intersection of lighting, animation, music, and advertising, and my experience as a freelancer has given me insight into each industry at a variety of roles. From drawing camera movements to optimizing meta ad campaigns or integrating content across different web environments, I am a very versatile worker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Personally and professionally, I'm in community with lighting designers that I know from Parsons, and I've seen how much beautiful marketing materials influence their specification decisions. Companies like Baso and DMF do this really wellâ€”their renders give personality to fixtures that could easily come across as purely technical. I'd love to bring that same level of artistry to Coronet's work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I'm familiar with the active social world of the lighting industry. I have attended trade shows, had conversations with manufacturers, and know how people in this industry balance fun and hard work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I truly love light, music, and motion. In my work as a concert lighting designer in New York, I craft emotional experiences and leverage human perceptual sensitivity across sight and sound to make moments feel huge (or empty).
                </p>

                <p>
                    My freelancing career spans 10 years, and I'm used to working independently to meet deadlines and nail key details. I'm available to start right away and would love to talk more about how I can help bring Coronet's products to life through animation.
                </p>
